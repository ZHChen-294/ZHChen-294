<!-- ===== Research Interest ===== -->
<h2>Research Interest</h2>
<p>
I work in the field of computer science and technology, with a specific focus on advancing methodologies for computational vision and intelligent image analysis. 
My research bridges tensor modeling, high-performance computing, and multimodal learning for large-scale visual data processing and restoration. 
Currently, I explore hybrid frameworks that integrate physics-driven models with data-driven AI to achieve robust, scalable, and interpretable imaging solutions. 
My recent work centers on the following themes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Efficient Image Reconstruction with Deep Priors</li>
  <li>Cloud Removal in Remote Sensing Images</li>
  <li>Unsupervised Image Deblurring with Uncertainty Modeling</li>
  <li>Advanced Denoising Techniques for Hyperspectral Images</li>
</ul>
